locality sensitive hashing(LSH)

either rigorous or adhoc

locality sensitive B-tree

more broadly:LSB-forest 

query cost should increase sub-linearly with the cardinality for all data and query distributions.

the process of building a LSB-tree is very simple. first convert a d-dimensional dataset to an m-dimensional dataset. and obtain z-order of them.

the main query algorithm in this paper is ***KNN***

learn sth from it.

Question:

**For our paper, how to deal with false negative circumstance.**
